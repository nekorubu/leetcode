- Maybe what I could do is
	- For each element in `fruits`
		- For each element in `baskets`
			- If `baskets[y] >= fruits[x]`
				- Remove `baskets[y]` and `fruits[x]`
					- `continue` to the next iteration
						- It's probably implied that this will do this, though
							- Actually, maybe not
						- Actually, might want to `break` after all
					- Unfortunately, this won't work unless I change `fruits` and `baskets` to be mutable
						- Which I'm assuming that I can't, so I won't
							- I could clone the vectors and manipulate those, but there might be a simpler, less memory intensive way to do that...
								- Actually, doing that doesn't work either...
									- I need to keep track of which baskets have been used
										- Maybe create vectors that contain the indices of the baskets/fruits that have been placed?
									- Actually, I think the issue was probably coming from the
	- Once we've gotten to the end, count up the amount of leftover fruit types and return it
		- Could probably get `fruits.len()` and convert that to an `i32` from a `usize`
