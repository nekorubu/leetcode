# [3479. Fruit Into Baskets III](https://leetcode.com/problems/fruits-into-baskets-iii/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-08-06)

This one actually threw me for a bit of a loop at first, since it looked extremely similar to [the one from the day before](../05/3477.fruit-into-baskets-ii.rs). However, when I used my solution from yesterday in this one, it worked fine! That is, until the final test cases with extremely large numbers that caused the last few tests to fail because they took too long. Unfortunately, I was unable to finish the problem within the time I set for myself to work on it. It runs, but it fails the first of the two run test cases.

I think that that test failed simply because I was trying to use a binary search, going off of the tags for the problem. By sorting the baskets, more of the fruit are able to be placed into baskets, more than the actual solution would've allowed for. I was thinking that a segment tree could possibly work, but I have yet to test that theory, given that I've only looked at a page about segment trees to get a rough idea of what they are.
