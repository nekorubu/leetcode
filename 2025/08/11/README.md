# [2438. Range Product Queries of Powers](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-product-queries-of-powers/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-08-11)

At the point when I did this problem, I hadn't done a LeetCode problem in a few days, so this one threw me for a loop. Actually, that doesn't even begin to describe how confused I was. Multiple times while reading the problem, I was considering just not doing it and just practicing Python on Codewars instead. However, checking the comments, I saw that I wasn't the only one who was confused by the question. Thankfully, [this comment](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-product-queries-of-powers/description/comments/3115462/) described what they were actually asking for. Thank you very much, [peterguyen04](https://leetcode.com/u/peternguyen04/).

Once I figured out what they were actually asking you to do, I was finally able to get started on [breaking down the problem](./raw-notes.md). From here, the main issues were just trying to make sure that I did the Python syntax right, as well as trying to figure out ways to solve the smaller problems I needed to solve.

The funniest moment while solving this came from line 7, where I was trying to figure out how to find the nearest power of 2 to the number I was given. As I was searching, I came across [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/7ga2ng/how_to_find_the_closest_power/) asking for the same thing. [The top comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/7ga2ng/how_to_find_the_closest_power/dqhvcod/) spoke directly to me:

> Logarithm. You want to calculate the log.
<sub>mfw i forget that logarithms exist</sub>

Once I was done with that, though, I just needed to figure out how to produce the answer from the first test case to solve the rest of them. Thankfully, I didn't have to optimize it any more to beat the time limit, though I'm aware that [my solution](./2438.range-product-queries-of-powers.py) isn't the fastest one by any means.
