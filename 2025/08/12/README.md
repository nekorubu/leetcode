This one took me a bit to get started on, as I had to try and think of a way to even begin to get started on doing the problem. At one point, I even had to stop to try and *hand-draw* out what I wanted to get done, since typing it out wasn't working for my brain. You can see it at the end of [the raw notes](./raw-notes.md). At least, once I started coding, there was a moment when I realized that I actually wanted the `x`-th root of the number instead of the logarithm that I thought I needed since I rediscovered them [yesterday](https://github.com/nekorubu/leetcode/tree/master/2025/08/11), so that was kind of funny.

Unfortunately, I didn't finish this within the time I set aside for myself. I managed to solve the first 2 test cases when I came up with my original solution, then failed at 995 test cases. If you look at [my last attempt at the problem](./2787.ways-to-express-an-integer-as-sum-of-powers.py), you'll see a bunch of commented `print()` lines from me debugging because I haven't gotten around to trying to figure out how to debug in Neovim yet. I commented them out so that if you want to try and debug it yourself, you won't have to deal with the output spam, especially if you have a Python IDE or something like that set up already.

Maybe it's because I was trying to solve the problem out in a way that would've been better for a language like C or Rust that I had such a hard time with this one. Maybe I was thinking too much on a low level about this problem...

Other than that, I don't really have anything else to say about this one. At least I started on it and got a bit better at documenting my thinking process.
