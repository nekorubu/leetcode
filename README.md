# LeetCode solutions

Here are the solutions to LeetCode problems that I work on each day. Each one has a `README` with some comments about each problem and the thoughts I was having, as well as a `raw-notes.md` file with the original notes that I made as I was trying to solve the problem. Well, at least at the beginning before my brain starts doing mach 30 and I forget to even stop and think. The format isn't really meant to be read by the public, so it may not make a lot of sense, but hopefully, it gives people a glimpse into the way I was thinking through this.

Most (if not all) of these were solved in Rust because I was trying to learn it when I started doing these.
